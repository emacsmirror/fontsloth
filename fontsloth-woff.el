;;; Commentary:

;; Part of fontsloth: the slowest font renderer in the world written in pure

;; fontsloth-woff (this file): uses bindat to parse woff files

;; To use this module by itself, load and enable it as follows:
;;   (use-package fontsloth-woff)

;;; Code:

(require 'bindat)

    (total-sfnt-size uint 32)
    (major-version uint 16)
    (minor-version uint 16)
    (meta-offset uint 32)
    (meta-length uint 32)
    (meta-orig-length uint 32)
    (priv-offset uint 32)
    (priv-length uint 32))
  "A spec for a WOFF file header.
